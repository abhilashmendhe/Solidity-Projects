/*
    Build a multi-currency digital tip jar! Users can send Ether directly or simulate tips in foreign currencies like USD or EUR. 
    You'll learn how to manage currency conversion, handle Ether payments using `payable` and `msg.value`, and keep track of individual contributions. 
    Think of it like an advanced version of a 'Buy Me a Coffee' button — but smarter, more global, and Solidity-powered.
