# Cross-chain Rebase Token

Please read this [article on Rebase Token](https://www.chiliz.com/rebase-tokens-explained-elastic-supply-crypto/). 

1. A protocol that allows user to deposit into a vault and in return, receiver rebase tokens that represent their underlying balance.
2. Rebase token -> balanceOf function is dynamic to show the changing balance with time.
    - Balance increases linearly with time.
    - Mint tokens to our users everytime they perform an action (minting, burning, transferring, or .. bridging)
3. Interest rate
    - Individually set an interest rate or each user based on some global interest rate of the protocol at the time the user deposits into the vault.
    - This global interest rate can only decrease to incentivise/reward early adopters.
